• User Measurement Input: Users enter body measurements (height, bust, waist, hips), which dynamically scale a
3D avatar model to match their body shape
• Dress Customization Fitting: Users select dress types, sizes (S/M/L), and colors/patterns. The app calculates if
a dress fits the avatar using geometric matching logic.
• 3D Visualization with React + Three.js: The app renders the avatar and dress using react-three-fiber, allowing
real-time viewing, scaling, and rotation of 3D models in a browser.
• Avatar Customization (in progress): The project supports skin/hair/eye color customization, and plans are
underway to enable deeper face/body customization using Ready Player Me avatars.
